        question: "What is the difference between the local variable and global variable in C?",
        answer: `
Following are the differences between a local variable and global variable:

Basis for comparison
Local variable
Global variable
Declaration
A variable which is declared inside function or block is known as a local variable.
A variable which is declared outside function or block is known as a global variable.
Scope
The scope of a variable is available within a function in which they are declared.
The scope of a variable is available throughout the program.
Access
Variables can be accessed only by those statements inside a function in which they are declared.
Any statement in the entire program can access variables.
Life
Life of a variable is created when the function block is entered and destroyed on its exit.
Life of a variable exists until the program is executing.
Storage
Variables are stored in a stack unless specified.
The compiler decides the storage location of a variable.

        question: "What is the use of a static variable in C?",
        answer: `
Following are the uses of a static variable:

A variable which is declared as static is known as a static variable. The static variable retains its value between multiple function calls.
Static variables are used because the scope of the static variable is available in the entire program. So, we can access a static variable anywhere in the program.
The static variable is initially initialized to zero. If we update the value of a variable, then the updated value is assigned.
The static variable is used as a common value which is shared by all the methods.
The static variable is initialized only once in the memory heap to reduce the memory usage.

Uses of C function are:

C functions are used to avoid the rewriting the same code again and again in our program.
C functions can be called any number of times from any place of our program.
When a program is divided into functions, then any part of our program can easily be tracked.
C functions provide the reusability concept, i.e., it breaks the big task into smaller tasks so that it makes the C program more understandable.

        question: "What is the difference between call by value and call by reference in C?",
        answer: `
Following are the differences between a call by value and call by reference:

Call by value
Call by reference
Description
When a copy of the value is passed to the function, then the original value is not modified.
When a copy of the value is passed to the function, then the original value is modified.
Memory location
Actual arguments and formal arguments are created in separate memory locations.
Actual arguments and formal arguments are created in the same memory location.
Safety
In this case, actual arguments remain safe as they cannot be modified.
In this case, actual arguments are not reliable, as they are modified.
Arguments
The copies of the actual arguments are passed to the formal arguments.
The addresses of actual arguments are passed to their respective formal arguments.

Example of call by value:

#include <stdio.h>  
void change(int,int);  
int main()  
{  
    int a=10,b=20;  
    change(a,b); //calling a function by passing the values of variables.  
    printf("Value of a is: %d",a);  
    printf("\\n");  
    printf("Value of b is: %d",b);  
    return 0;  
}  
void change(int x,int y)  
{  
    x=13;  
    y=17;  
}  

Output:

Value of a is: 10
Value of b is: 20

Example of call by reference:

#include <stdio.h>  
void change(int*,int*);  
int main()  
{  
    int a=10,b=20;  
    change(&a,&b); // calling a function by passing references of variables.  
    printf("Value of a is: %d",a);  
    printf("\\n");  
    printf("Value of b is: %d",b);  
    return 0;  
}  
void change(int *x,int *y)  
{  
    *x=13;  
    *y=17;

        question: "What is recursion in C?",
        answer: `
When a function calls itself, and this process is known as recursion. The function that calls itself is known as a recursive function.

Recursive function comes in two phases:

Winding phase
Unwinding phase
Winding phase: When the recursive function calls itself, and this phase ends when the condition is reached.

Unwinding phase: Unwinding phase starts when the condition is reached, and the control returns to the original call.

Example of recursion

#include <stdio.h>  
int calculate_fact(int);  
int main()  
{  
 int n=5,f;  
 f=calculate_fact(n); // calling a function  
 printf("factorial of a number is %d",f);

int calculate_fact(int a)  
{  
  if(a==1)  
  {  
      return 1;  
  }

        question: "What is an array in C?",
        answer: `
An Array is a group of similar types of elements. It has a contiguous memory location. It makes the code optimized, easy to traverse and easy to sort. The size and type of arrays cannot be changed after its declaration.

Arrays are of two types:

One-dimensional array: One-dimensional array is an array that stores the elements one after the another.
Syntax:

data_type array_name[size];  

Multidimensional array: Multidimensional array is an array that contains more than one array.
Syntax:

data_type array_name[size];  

Example of an array:

#include <stdio.h>  
int main()  
{  
   int arr[5]={1,2,3,4,5}; //an array consists of five integer values.  
   for(int i=0;i<5;i++)  
   {

        question: "What is a pointer in C?",
        answer: `
A pointer is a variable that refers to the address of a value. It makes the code optimized and makes the performance fast. Whenever a variable is declared inside a program, then the system allocates some memory to a variable. The memory contains some address number. The variables that hold this address number is known as the pointer variable.

For example:

Data_type *p;  

The above syntax tells that p is a pointer variable that holds the address number of a given data type value.

Example of pointer

#include <stdio.h>  
int main()  
{  
   int *p; //pointer of type integer.  
   int a=5;  
   p=&a;  
   printf("Address value of 'a' variable is %u",p);  
    return 0;  
}  

Output:

Address value of 'a' variable is 428781252

        question: "What is the usage of the pointer in C?",
        answer: `
Accessing array elements: Pointers are used in traversing through an array of integers and strings. The string is an array of characters which is terminated by a null character '\\0'.
Dynamic memory allocation: Pointers are used in allocation and deallocation of memory during the execution of a program.
Call by Reference: The pointers are used to pass a reference of a variable to other function.
Data Structures like a tree, graph, linked list, etc.: The pointers are used to construct different data structures like tree, graph, linked list, etc.

    {
        question: "What is a NULL pointer in C?",
        answer: `
A pointer that doesn't refer to any address of value but NULL is known as a NULL pointer. When we assign a '0' value to a pointer of any type, then it becomes a Null pointer.

    },
    {
        question: "What is dangling pointer in C?",
        answer: `
If a pointer is pointing any memory location, but meanwhile another pointer deletes the memory occupied by the first pointer while the first pointer still points to that memory location, the first pointer will be known as a dangling pointer. This problem is known as a dangling pointer problem.
Dangling pointer arises when an object is deleted without modifying the value of the pointer. The pointer points to the deallocated memory.
Let's see this through an example.

#include<stdio.h>  
void main()  
{  
        int *ptr = malloc(constant value); //allocating a memory space.  
        free(ptr); //ptr becomes a dangling pointer.  
}  

In the above example, initially memory is allocated to the pointer variable ptr, and then the memory is deallocated from the pointer variable. Now, pointer variable, i.e., ptr becomes a dangling pointer.

How to overcome the problem of a dangling pointer

The problem of a dangling pointer can be overcome by assigning a NULL value to the dangling pointer. Let's understand this through an example:

#include<stdio.h>  
      void main()  
      {  
              int *ptr = malloc(constant value); //allocating a memory space.  
              free(ptr); //ptr becomes a dangling pointer.  
              ptr=NULL; //Now, ptr is no longer a dangling pointer.  
      }  

In the above example, after deallocating the memory from a pointer variable, ptr is assigned to a NULL value. This means that ptr does not point to any memory location. Therefore, it is no longer a dangling pointer.
`
    },
    {
        question: "What is pointer to pointer in C?",
        answer: `
In case of a pointer to pointer concept, one pointer refers to the address of another pointer. The pointer to pointer is a chain of pointers. Generally, the pointer contains the address of a variable. The pointer to pointer contains the address of a first pointer. Let's understand this concept through an example:

#include <stdio.h>  
 int main()  
{  
    int a=10;  
    int *ptr,**pptr; // *ptr is a pointer and **pptr is a double pointer.  
    ptr=&a;  
    pptr=&ptr;  
    printf("value of a is:%d",a);  
    printf("\\n");  
    printf("value of *ptr is : %d",*ptr);  
    printf("\\n");  
    printf("value of **pptr is : %d",**pptr);  
    return 0;  
}  

In the above example, pptr is a double pointer pointing to the address of the ptr variable and ptr points to the address of 'a' variable.

    {
        question: "What is static memory allocation?",
        answer: `
In case of static memory allocation, memory is allocated at compile time, and memory can't be increased while executing the program. It is used in the array.
The lifetime of a variable in static memory is the lifetime of a program.
The static memory is allocated using static keyword.
The static memory is implemented using stacks or heap.
The pointer is required to access the variable present in the static memory.
The static memory is faster than dynamic memory.
In static memory, more memory space is required to store the variable.

For example:  
int a[10];  

The above example creates an array of integer type, and the size of an array is fixed, i.e., 10.
`
    },
    {
        question: "What is dynamic memory allocation?",
        answer: `
In case of dynamic memory allocation, memory is allocated at runtime and memory can be increased while executing the program. It is used in the linked list.
The malloc() or calloc() function is required to allocate the memory at the runtime.
An allocation or deallocation of memory is done at the execution time of a program.
No dynamic pointers are required to access the memory.
The dynamic memory is implemented using data segments.
Less memory space is required to store the variable.

For example  
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int)*10);  

The above example allocates the memory at runtime.

`
    },
    {
        question: "What functions are used for dynamic memory allocation in C language?",
        answer: `
Syntax

ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size) // allocating the memory using malloc() function.  

Syntax

ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size);// allocating the memory using calloc() function.  

Syntax

ptr = realloc(ptr, newsize); // updating the memory size using realloc() function.  

In the above syntax, ptr is allocated to a new size.

Syntax

free(ptr); // memory is released using free() function.  

The above syntax releases the memory from a pointer variable ptr.

malloc()
The malloc() function is used to allocate the memory during the execution of the program.
It does not initialize the memory but carries the garbage value.
It returns a null pointer if it could not be able to allocate the requested space.

calloc()
The calloc() is same as malloc() function, but the difference only is that it initializes the memory with zero value.

realloc()
The realloc() function is used to reallocate the memory to the new size.
If sufficient space is not available in the memory, then the new block is allocated to accommodate the existing data.

free(): The free() function releases the memory allocated by either calloc() or malloc() function.

    {
        question: "What is the difference between malloc() and calloc()?",
        answer: `
calloc()
malloc()
Description
The malloc() function allocates a single block of requested memory.
The calloc() function allocates multiple blocks of requested memory.
Initialization
It initializes the content of the memory to zero.
It does not initialize the content of memory, so it carries the garbage value.
Number of arguments
It consists of two arguments.
It consists of only one argument.
Return value
It returns a pointer pointing to the allocated memory.
It returns a pointer pointing to the allocated memory.

        question: "What is the structure?",
        answer: `
The structure is a user-defined data type that allows storing multiple types of data in a single unit. It occupies the sum of the memory of all members.
The structure members can be accessed only through structure variables.
Structure variables accessing the same structure but the memory allocated for each variable will be different.

Syntax of structure

struct structure_name  
{  
  Member_variable1;  
  Member_variable2;  
  .  
  .  
}[structure variables];  

Let's see a simple example.

#include <stdio.h>  
struct student  
{  
    char name[10];       // structure members declaration.  
    int age;  
}s1;      //structure variable  
int main()  
{  
    printf("Enter the name");  
    scanf("%s",s1.name);  
    printf("\\n");  
    printf("Enter the age");  
    scanf("%d",&s1.age);  
    printf("\\n");  
    printf("Name and age of a student: %s,%d",s1.name,s1.age);

        question: "What is a union?",
        answer: `
The union is a user-defined data type that allows storing multiple types of data in a single unit. However, it doesn't occupy the sum of the memory of all members. It holds the memory of the largest member only.
In union, we can access only one variable at a time as it allocates one common space for all the members of a union.

Syntax of union

union union_name  
{  
  Member_variable1;  
  Member_variable2;  
  .  
  .  
  Member_variable n;  
}[union variables];  

Let's see a simple example

#include<stdio.h>  
union data  
{  
    int a;      //union members declaration.  
    float b;  
    char ch;  
};  
int main()  
{  
  union data d;       //union variable.  
  d.a=3;  
  d.b=5.6;  
  d.ch='a';  
  printf("value of a is %d",d.a);  
  printf("\\n");  
  printf("value of b is %f",d.b);  
  printf("\\n");  
  printf("value of ch is %c",d.ch);  
  return 0;  
}  

Output:

value of a is 1085485921
value of b is 5.600022
value of ch is a

In the above example, the value of a and b gets corrupted, and only variable ch shows the actual output. This is because all the members of a union share the common memory space. Hence, the variable ch whose value is currently updated.

        question: "What is the difference between getch() and getche()?",
        answer: `
The getch() function reads a single character from the keyboard. It doesn't use any buffer, so entered data will not be displayed on the output screen.

The getche() function reads a single character from the keyword, but data is displayed on the output screen. Press Alt+f5 to see the entered character.

Let's see a simple example

#include<stdio.h>  
#include<conio.h>  
int main()  
{      
 char ch;  
 printf("Enter a character ");  
 ch=getch(); // taking an user input without printing the value.  
 printf("\\nvalue of ch is %c",ch);  
 printf("\\nEnter a character again ");  
 ch=getche(); // taking an user input and then displaying it on the screen.  
 printf("\\nvalue of ch is %c",ch);  
 return 0;  
}  

Output:

Enter a character
value of ch is a
Enter a character again a
value of ch is a

In the above example, the value entered through a getch() function is not displayed on the screen while the value entered through a getche() function is displayed on the screen.
